enhanced robot arm joint using onshape
Improved Joint Design for Robot Arm using FEA simulation 
📌 Task Overview
The objective of this task is to enhance the joint design to achieve better strength and durability. This improvement should consider certain predefined dimensions while ensuring overall structural integrity.
🛠️ Requirements
Develop an optimized joint design with superior robustness compared to the original version.
Respect the given predefined dimensional constraints.

🔬 Testing & Validation
After submission, each design will be tested using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to simulate real-world performance.
The analysis will evaluate stress distribution, deformation, and overall strength.

A comparative analysis will be conducted between:
- The original baseline design
- The newly optimized design

✅ Deliverables
Optimized CAD model of the joint.

FEA simulation results (report or images).
